## 1. About HR-GCN-FF-DA Model (Our proposed deep learning architecture)

HR-GCN-FF-DA are a family of semantic segmentatiom models, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on Remote Sensing corpus, yet being an extracting features with higher quality and more efficient than our previous models [[link]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/1/83).


HR-GCN-FF-DA are developed based on the advanced backbone, a new High-Resolution Representation (HR), and a modern deep learning technique:

</p>

  * **Backbone**: we employ the more advanced [HRNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07919) as our new backbone networks.
  * **DA**: we apply a new depthwise atrous convolution [DA](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Pang_Towards_Bridging_Semantic_Gap_to_Improve_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) feature network to enable easy and combine with our feature fusion. 


## 2. Pretrained HR-GCN-FF-DA Checkpoints

We have provided a list of EfficientNet checkpoints for HR-GCN-FF-DA checkpoints:.

  ** All checkpoints are trained with augmentation.

## 3. Run inference.

Files and Directories

- **train.py:** Training on the dataset of your choice. Default is Landsat-8w3c

- **test.py:** Testing on the dataset of your choice. Default is Landsat-8w3c

### Installation
This project has the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow `sudo pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu`

- OpenCV Python `sudo apt-get install python-opencv`

### Usage
The only thing you have to do to get started is set up the folders in the following structure:

    ├── "corpus_name"                   
    |   ├── train
    |   ├── train_labels
    |   ├── val
    |   ├── val_labels
    |   ├── test
    |   ├── test_labels

Put a text file under the dataset directory called "our_class_dict.csv" which contains the list of classes along with the R, G, B colour labels to visualize the segmentation results. This kind of dictionairy is usually supplied with the dataset. Here is an example for the Landsat-8w5c dataset:

```
name,r,g,b
Agriculture or Harvested area,255,255,155
Forest,56,168,0
Urban,255,0, 0
Water,0, 122, 255
Miscellaneous,183, 140, 31
```

## 4. Results.
**Note:** If you are using any of the networks that rely on a pre-trained HRNet or ResNet, then you will need to download the pre-trained weights using the provided script on section 2. These are currently: GCN152-TL-A and HR-GCN-FF-DA.

Then you can simply run `train.py`! Check out the optional command line arguments:
